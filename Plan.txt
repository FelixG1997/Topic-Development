Basics:
- cylinders per plain
- each Cylinder needs a Skript with OnClickListerner
-> create bars
-> rename plain
-> rotate plain (if it's more easy, rotate bars)
-> delete bars

- each bars needs a Skript with OnClickListerner
-> create lines to other bars
-> dye line
-> delete line


Additional:
- Camera rotation
- "Topic Development" in background
- create jar
